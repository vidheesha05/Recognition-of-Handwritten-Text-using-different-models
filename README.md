# Recognition-of-Handwritten-Text-using-different-models
The comparison of different state-of-the-art models is done using Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. In this gating mechanism is used in the convolutional neural networks. The metrics compared are Accuracy, Character Error Rate and Word Error Rate.
